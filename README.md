# Open Kitchen 

Open kitchen is an open source project that will help the community to build automated kitchens; preparing meals without the fuss of cooking everything from scratch. 

The main components of the open kitchen project are:

1. Inventory System ( which will hold all the portions of the ingredients that the products require )
1. Delivery Runners ( There will be two kinds : Ingredient runner and Sauces runner )
1. Woks ( the woks will cook the food till everything is well done )

## Inventory System

The entire system is built on the idea of having a map of portion containers. Making a grid of squares and each position in the grid holds a container. 

Each container can hold upto 20 portions. 

Now let's pretend we have a grid of 5 columns with 5 rows. making a total of 25 different positions with a total of 500 portions.
